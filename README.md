# Pet_Health_Monitoring

This is the project titled *‘Pet Health Monitoring’* by *Tanmay Sugandhi, Rohit Chand, Manichand, Chandrashekar, Jerry K. Paul*. 
This is a record of the project work carried out by us, during the year *2022-2023* as part of *INDUCTION* under the guidance and supervision of *Mr D.P. Naga Ajay Kumar & Ms P. Tapaswini* (Technical Heads) and *Mr T. Bharat Kumar* (The President of THE ROBOTICS CLUB)

## Abstract
Every living creature on this earth has equal importance within the ecosystem. But at present, the lives of the animals are in risk. There is an increasing number of issues regarding various animal health condition and movements. And in recent era, pets have become an integral part of a human life. For many of us, pets are real family members, and we take care of them, their health, and wellbeing. At present to detect the health status of animal we required to wait for veterinary expertise which take long time for its arrival.

## Introduction
As the healthcare industry continues to embrace the digital era and advance remote patient monitoring, it’s no surprise that this technology is also transforming the pet health industry.  With everything from wearable devices to smart health monitoring platforms, owners can now use a variety of wearable and non-wearable pet accessories to track almost every area of their pet’s health.  the wireless pet wearables industry has expanded from location trackers to include solutions powered by IoT technologies that help owners monitor their pet’s health. PET’s HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM is a wearable always-on health tracker that monitors a pet’s health and activity levels to generate a wellness score, providing the owner with a big picture of the animal’s overall health. While some wearable trackers are wireless tags attached to a normal pet collar, the Pet Pace Collar is an actual collar. Designed for both cats and dogs, it continuously monitors and measures their vital signs, including activity, pulse, temperature, and number of steps. It provides a convenient and accurate way to monitor pets with existing medical issues while aiding with preventative care. Owners and veterinarians can get comprehensive, accurate, and immediate information about an animal’s health via the website and smartphone app.

## Problem Statement
Pet’s health monitoring system is a belt which can be used to check all the vital parameters of their pets in real-time. Such belts can measure heart rate, temperature etc. By using ECG sensor, we can measure heart rate and with temperature sensor we can measure the pet’s body temperature. If any serious changes occur in any parameters that can be taken as signs of illness, it will send an alert to a pet owner. Physical activity is very important for pets. Modern applications can analyse walking distance, time of activity per day etc. We can use ADXL accelerometer to count the steps during walking. If a pet is not active enough during the day, an owner will be notified. To control all the sensors, we use NodeMCU8266 microcontroller.

## Working
    i. Initially the belt which is made through the idea is attached to the pets.
    ii. Then if the supply is connected the product start working.
    iii. The sensors which are attached will senses the body of the pets a show them in the mobile application which is developed.
    iv. So that the user monitors the health of the pets.
    v. If the readings are less than the threshold then the owners can make necessary steps.
